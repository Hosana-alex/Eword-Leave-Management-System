# Work Management System Expansion Approach

## Strategy: Google Sheets â†’ Web Application
The expansion will be based on replicating and improving the existing Google Sheets workflows currently used by EWORD Publishers.

## Analysis Framework
For each Google Sheet to be replicated:
1. **Document current functionality** and user workflows
2. **Map data relationships** and business logic
3. **Design equivalent web interfaces** with improved UX
4. **Implement enhanced features** that sheets cannot provide
5. **Migrate data** and train users on new system

## Implementation Principles
- **Preserve existing workflows** users are familiar with
- **Enhance with web app capabilities** (real-time updates, notifications, mobile access)
- **Maintain data integrity** during migration
- **Provide training** for smooth transition
- **Phase rollout** to minimize disruption

## Technical Approach
- **Database design** based on sheet structures
- **API endpoints** to handle sheet-like operations
- **UI components** that mirror familiar sheet layouts
- **Import/export functionality** for data migration
- **Real-time updates** for collaborative features

## Success Metrics
- User adoption rate of new web features
- Reduction in manual data entry errors
- Improved workflow efficiency
- Enhanced reporting capabilities
- Mobile accessibility usage
