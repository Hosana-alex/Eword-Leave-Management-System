# Google Sheets Replication Plan

## Company's Current Google Sheets System
- **Purpose**: Document the existing Google Sheets workflows used by EWORD Publishers
- **Goal**: Replicate the logic and features from these sheets into the web application
- **Approach**: Analyze each sheet's structure, formulas, and business logic

## Sheets Analysis Framework
For each Google Sheet, document:
- **Sheet Purpose**: What business function it serves
- **Data Structure**: Columns, data types, relationships
- **Formulas & Logic**: Calculations and automated processes
- **User Workflows**: How staff currently use the sheet
- **Integration Points**: How sheets connect to each other

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Analyze existing sheets** and document their functionality
2. **Design database models** to replicate the data structure
3. **Build web interfaces** that match current workflows
4. **Implement business logic** from sheet formulas
5. **Add improvements** that web apps can provide over sheets

## Benefits of Web App Migration
- **Real-time collaboration** instead of sheet conflicts
- **Better data validation** and error prevention
- **Automated workflows** and notifications
- **Mobile accessibility** for field work
- **Integration capabilities** with other systems
- **Backup and security** improvements
